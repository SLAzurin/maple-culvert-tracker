# Maple Culvert Tracker

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/G2G0WUCP2)

This software helps track Maplestory culvert scores over time!

This software is best used in conjunction with my https://github.com/SLAzurin/gpq-image-ocr-gui

Join the Discord server for update notifications! Here: Server under construction.

A lot of work still needs to be done to be considered a well established Open Source software, so it is like Public Source instead.

# Pre-requisites

Install Docker Engine (Linux) or Docker Desktop (Linux/Windows/Mac) for development.  
Install Golang 1.22.x or newer versions when developing.  
Install Nodejs 20.x or newer even number LTS versions. (Using [nvm.sh](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is recommended)  
Enable `pnpm` with this command:

- Command: `corepack enable && corepack prepare --activate`

## Small note

Hosting this on the Cloud is recommended to keep stable uptime.

I suggest the following providers for competitive pricing:

- [OVH Cloud](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/vps/)
- [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/)

You can pick any cpu size, but I'd suggest a minimum of 1gb of ram and 40gb of storage.

# developer notes

1. Setup the discord bot and their permissions and make it join your test server.
2. Setup the `.env` file according to `.env.template`.
3. Run the `chartmaker`, `db16`, `valkey` containers.
   - Command: `docker compose -f base.yml -f dev.yml up -d chartmaker db16 valkey`
   - Connect inside the db16 container: `docker compose exec db16 sh`
   - Run the sql files: `psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -d $POSTGRES_DB </root/sqlfiles/createdb.sql`
4. Run the `update_commands` Go app once only.
   - Command: `go run cmd/update_commands/*.go`
5. Run the `main` Go app (discord bot) process and leave it running in the background.
   - Command: `go run cmd/main/*.go`
6. Install Nodejs dependencies with `pnpm`:
   - Command: `pnpm i`
7. Run the Website control panel and leave it in the background.
   - Command: `cd culvert-web ; pnpm run dev`

# production deployment

1. Setup the discord bot and their permissions and make it join your server.
2. Setup the `.env` file according to `.env.template`.
3. Build and run the update_commands entrypoint once
   - Command: `go build -o update_commands ./cmd/update_commands/*.go `
   - Copy it to the production server, next to the docker-compose.yml file
   - Run: `./update_commands`
4. Use docker compose, and run the following command:
   - Command: `docker compose up -d`
   - Connect inside the db16 container: `docker compose exec db16 sh`
   - Run the sql files: `psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -d $POSTGRES_DB </root/sqlfiles/createdb.sql`

# backing up the postgres db

1. Connect to the db container with a shell and run a pg_dump
   - Run: `docker compose exec db16 sh -c "pg_dump -U \$POSTGRES_USER -d \$POSTGRES_DB >/root/sqlfiles/dump.sql"`
   - The `dump.sql` is the database dump file (inside the `./sqlfiles/` path)
   - Backup that file "somewhere".

# restoring a db backup

1. Copy the dump inside the container then connect into it and run the sql file.
   - Copy the `dump.sql` inside the `./sqlfiles/` path.
   - Run: `docker compose exec db16 sh`
   - Run: `psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -d postgres`
   - Drop and re-create $POSTGRES_DB: `drop database mapleculverttrackerdb; create database mapleculverttrackerdb;` then `exit` the db connection
   - Run the sql backup: `psql -U $POSTGRES_USER -d $POSTGRES_DB </root/sqlfiles/dump.sql`
   - You are done restoring the backup.
